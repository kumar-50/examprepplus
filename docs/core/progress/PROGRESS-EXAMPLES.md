## 📊 How Scores are Calculated (Step-by-Step)

### Example: After Your Next Test (40% accuracy)

**Before Test:**
- Tests: 9, Questions: 40, Accuracy: 9.33%, Readiness: 31%

**After Test (assume 10 questions, 4 correct):**
- Tests: 10 ✅

**New Readiness Calculation:**
```
Accuracy:  11.0% × 0.4 = 4.4 points  (+0.67)
Coverage:  3/6   × 30  = 15.0 points (same)
Trend:     +1.67%      = 11.67 points (+1.67)
Volume:    10/50 × 10  = 2.0 points  (+0.20)
                         ─────────────
                         33% TOTAL (+2%)
```
