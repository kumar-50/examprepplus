# 12 Practice Mode

## Objective

Allow untimed question-by-question practice with immediate feedback.

## Steps

1. Mode toggle (practice vs test) before start.
2. Single question view with submit answer button.
3. Show correctness + explanation immediately.
4. Next question navigation (sequential or random within topic).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Feedback appears only after user submits.
- Time not recorded.

## Best Practices

- Share question component logic with test engine; vary behavior via props.
